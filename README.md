## 🚀 About The Project

**StacksRank** is engineered to be the ultimate companion for the **Stacks Builder Rewards** campaign (Jan 19-31). 

With a total prize pool of **15,300 STX** distributed to high-impact developers, StacksRank serves as both a demonstration of technical excellence and a tool for builders to track their standing.

### 🎯 Built for the Leaderboard

2.  **✅ Essential Stacks Libraries**: Deep integration of `@stacks/connect` and `@stacks/transactions` for robust wallet interaction.
3.  **✅ Public Contribution**: Open-source repository driving GitHub activity and ecosystem value.
4.  **✅ Bitcoin L2 Wallet Support**: Native support for **Leather**, **Xverse**, and **Asigna** via browser injection.
