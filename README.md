## 🚀 About The Project

**StacksRank** isn't just a leaderboard; it's a dedicated engine for the Stacks builder economy. 

In the rapidly growing Bitcoin L2 ecosystem, recognizing top talent and providing them with trustworthy tools is paramount. **StacksRank** bridges this gap by combining three powerful pillars into one seamless decentralized application:

1.  **🏆 Dynamic Reputation Leaderboard**:  
    We track real-time on-chain activity, contributions, and engagement to rank the top builders in the ecosystem. Your code is your resume, and StacksRank makes it visible.

2.  **💱 Trustless Atomic Swaps**:  
    Need to move assets? Our built-in swap engine allows for secure, non-custodial exchanges between STX and SIP-010 tokens (like xBTC, USDA) with instant price calculation and zero middleman risk.

3.  **🔒 ClarityVault Service**:  
    For teams and DAOs, we offer **ClarityVault**—a secure, multi-signature treasury management solution built directly on Clarity 3 & 4 smart contracts, ensuring your community funds are safer than ever.

## ✨ Key Features

- **💎 Next-Gen Wallet Connection**:  
    We ditched the standard wrappers for a **Direct Leather Provider Integration**, ensuring a smooth, crash-free connection experience that feels native to the browser.

- **📈 Real-Time Data Indexing**:  
    Powered by the **Hiro API**, StacksRank fetches live balances, transaction histories, and contract states instantly. No stale data, ever.

- **⚡ Instant Atomic Logic**:  
    Our frontend swap engine calculates exchange rates for STX/xBTC pairs in milliseconds, providing users with accurate slippage estimates before they sign.

- **🛡️ Future-Proof Smart Contracts**:  
    Our contracts are written in **Clarity 3 & 4**, leveraging the latest improvements in safety, traits, and expressivity on the Stacks blockchain.
